# Conversation Management & Classification using Groq API

## Overview
This project demonstrates:
1. **Conversation Management**: Maintain chat history, truncate by turns/length, and perform periodic summarization.
2. **JSON Schema Extraction**: Extract structured user info (name, email, phone, location, age) from chat messages using Groq APIâ€™s OpenAI-compatible function calling, validated against a JSON schema.

## Usage

### Task 1: Conversation Management
- Add messages via `ConversationManager`.
- Summarization occurs every `k` turns.
- History can be truncated by number of turns or characters.

### Task 2: JSON Schema Extraction

- Validates results with `jsonschema`.
